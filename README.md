👋 Hi there! I'm a software engineer at FringeCore with a passion for both frontend and backend development.  
I specialize in JavaScript libraries and frameworks, particularly React, and enjoy building efficient Node.js and TypeScript applications.

🌐 Currently exploring:  
- Advanced backend development with Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Docker
- Immersive frontend experiences using Three.js and WebXR
- Game development with Unity3D
- Native desktop app creation

💡 Side projects:  
- A local network file-sharing CLI tool
- A collaborative app for co-working spaces
- A floating console for seamless multitasking

📫 Feel free to connect or check out some of my repositories below to see what I'm working on!
